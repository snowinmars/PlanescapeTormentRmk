    snowinmars '«In short: deconstruction is when you take something apart, change the parts, and put it back together again».'
    snowinmars '«The result looks similar to the original: the same elements, you might not even notice the difference».'
    snowinmars '«But you live with deconstruction for a minute, ten, a hundred — and it turns out the result is nothing like the original. It\'s completely different. Like a mosaic that can be assembled in two ways».'
    snowinmars '«Planescape: Torment is a deconstruction of an RPG. It has all the same elements as an RPG: character, leveling, skills, D&D, and a few dialogue options».'
    snowinmars '«But when you start to dive into the game, you realize that the combat and dialogue systems have swapped roles».'
    snowinmars '«Fights take place within conversations, and clubbing and rolling dice are just incidental activities».'

    snowinmars '«That plot was already well-worn in Shakespeare\'s time, but he retold it in a way that we remember the outline half a millennium later. That\'s why I\'ll spoil it right away».'
    snowinmars '«It\'s not that he was a boy, she was a girl. Although, он-она, все дела, though».'

    snowinmars '«For someone, that\'s enough. For most, it\'s not».'

    snowinmars '«I deliberately was not worried about the code quality or the graphics. My goal is to figure out whether the game could even be ported to RenPy».'
    snowinmars '«At first, I thought, that if big projects run on RenPy - RenPy has some jam in the jar».'
    snowinmars '«It has - but for different reasons».'
    snowinmars '«But as I decompile a novel - I recognist the same patterns over and over».'
    snowinmars '«Bunch of global variables, lack of autotesting and, afais, „RenPy is no more than a scripting enging“ paradigm».'

    snowinmars '«The architecture description you may find in this game repository».'
    snowinmars '«I sincerely doubted that RenPy could brrr this project, but now I\'m confident it can. Tough stuff».'
    snowinmars '«The main challenge is the dialogue system».'
    snowinmars '«While a standard visual novels are kinda wall of text, followed by a choice and even more more text - in PsT the player makes a choice after a couple of sentences».'
    snowinmars '«Again and again. There are no monologues in the usual sense here—well, except for this one I\'m writing now».'
    snowinmars '«This creates a monstrously complex dialog tree. I wasn\'t sure it could be easily managed and tested in RenPy. I wasn\'t sure it could be written at all».'
    snowinmars '«Thanks to NearInfinity team, I was able to simplify the translation of the dialogue\'s Cthulhu to trivial actions».'
    snowinmars '«NearInfinity allows you to retrieve all the necessary information in an ancient, but in format. The rest was a matter of technique».'

    snowinmars '«The first Python code was generated by deepseek r1, for which I\'m very grateful. Despite ten years of development, I still can\'t get the beauty of this language. And I don\'t want to, anymore».'
    snowinmars '«To be true, there is almost no neural network code left here: I rewrote everything by hand several times to shove thoughts into its sophisms».'
    snowinmars '«The images are doing as best they can for now — something is neural, something is original».'
    snowinmars '«When the tech demo starts to look like as a finished project, I\'ll hire an artist. For now, this is what it is».'
    snowinmars '«Thanks also to the text „Planescape: Torment - Novelization“ by, I believe, Chris Avellone and Colin McComb. I sometimes use it for descriptions».'
    snowinmars '«Trivially obvious: thanks to the authors of the original game».'
    snowinmars '«You may see their names in menu setting».'
